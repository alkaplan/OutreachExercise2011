# Fork of CMS Outreach excercise from 2011

See the original readme [here](https://github.com/katilp/OutreachExercise2011)

This repository is a modified version of the original that creates an "output.root" file with data from four lepton events that have been selected as Z candidates based on CMS criteria.  The output.root file contains one TTree, called "t1", which has the following branches:


Lepton1_energy | Lepton1_charge | Lepton1_pt | Lepton1_px | Lepton1_py | Lepton1_pz | Lepton1_phi | Lepton1_eta | Lepton1_flavor | Lepton2_energy | Lepton2_charge | Lepton2_pt | Lepton2_px | Lepton2_py | Lepton2_pz | Lepton2_phi | Lepton2_eta | Lepton2_flavor | Lepton3_energy | Lepton3_charge | Lepton3_pt | Lepton3_px | Lepton3_py | Lepton3_pz | Lepton3_phi | Lepton3_eta | Lepton3_flavor | Lepton4_energy | Lepton4_charge  | Lepton4_ | Lepton4_px | Lepton4_py | Lepton4_pz | Lepton4_phi | Lepton4_eta | Lepton4_flavor
